# Tarndeep
i'm a Year 12 student at the Ormiston Senior College

## My Whakapapa
I live with my family: my father, my mother, my twin sister, my little sister and my little brother

My parents come from Punjab, India and my siblings and I were born in Italy

At home we speak Punjabi and Italian, with my parents we speak mostly Punjabi and between me and my siblings we speak Italian and we don't speak in English at home

I moved here in New Zealand a year and a half ago

## My Interests
I like to spend my free time alone: watching videos, play videogames or listen to music

But i don't dislike to pass some time with my siblings

## My Future Goals
I would like to end the year with many credits and learn many intersting things

And i want to have a stable work and manage my free time
